# Java-Word2Vec-Interface

This is a Java interface for exploring word2vec models. Before using, ensure you have a `.bin` model file and a `.txt` vocab file (add -save-vocab to your training query). See *** for tips on word2vec model training.

As an example, I have included a model and vocab file trained on the Lord of the Rings novels. In practice, you'll want to work with much larger models to achieve interesting results.
