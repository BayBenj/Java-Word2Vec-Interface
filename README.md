# Java-Word2Vec-Interface

This is a Java interface for exploring word2vec models. Word2vec is a tool that builds word embeddings of texts, allowing you to perform vector arithmetic on words!

Before using, ensure you have a `.bin` model file and a `.txt` vocab file (add -save-vocab to your training query). See *** for tips on word2vec model training.

As an example, I have included a model and vocab file trained on the Lord of the Rings novels. In practice, you'll want to work with much larger models to achieve interesting results.

This tool supports the operations `sum`, `average`, `analogy`, and `single`.
